# S3 Upload Test

## Getting Started

Copy the example environment file and edit it with your configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
```

Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Start the application with the file you want to upload:
```bash
npm start ./path/to/file
```

**Note:** The `public` folder is ignored by version control, so you can put your files to upload there without worrying about them being committed to the repository.
